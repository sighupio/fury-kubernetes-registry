# Registry Module version 3.0.0

This is a major release containing an update to Harbor package with breaking changes.

## Changelog

- Update Harbor from version `v2.4.2` to `v2.7.0`.
- :warning: Changed the namespace from Harbor to Registry. This change was made to help when upgrading from previous versions using the approach lift and shift migration.
- :warning: Removed Clair as it is no longer the default scanner on Harbor [since version 2.2](https://goharbor.io/docs/2.7.0/install-config/harbor-compatibility-list/)
- The trivy configuration has been updated to download the vulnerability database once a day. To do this we have added: an init container in the statefullset, an ad-hoc rbac and a cronjob to restart the pod.
- The official exporter has been added in order to retrieve more metrics via prometheus.
- The [official grafana dashboard](https://github.com/goharbor/harbor/blob/main/contrib/grafana-dashborad/metrics-example.json) has been added with some changes.
- An alert on Prometheus has been added to verify the actual running of the Harbor components

## Upgrade path

There's no supported upgrade path for this module from `v2.0.0` to `v3.0.0`, the default namespace has also changed from harbor to registry.

The recommended approach is a lift and shift migration. Start by copying over all the images from the old instance to the new one using Harbor's native replication and then sync the users and permissions.
